# Python Packages Installation

Python packages are a collection of modules that extend the functionality of the language. They are usually installed using the default package manager, named `pip` (Preferred Installer Program) and are available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/).

Many packages are already part of the standard library (the collection of default modules that are installed along with Python), but there are many, many others that have to be installed manually.

Learning to install packages, resolve their installation and versioning issues and even developing them are key skills for any Python developer.

## Installation

By default, `pip` is installed along with Python, but it is easy to miss some step and skip its installation process, specially when using the source installation method.
