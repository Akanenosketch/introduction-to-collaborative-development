# Basic Formation Course

This repository contains all the necessary resources to achieve a basic formation on common DevOps tools and practices, Python programming and team collaboration for development teams.

## Introduction

This course is intended to be a foundation for collaborative development. It contains a set of selective picked software tools and practices that are commonly used in the industry. The course is divided in three main sections:

1. **Setup**: This section contains the necessary tools to be installed in your computer to be able to follow the course.
2. **Development**: This section contains the necessary resources to learn the basics of Python, Git and GitHub while using Visual Studio Code as editor tool.
3. **Testing**: This section contains the practical evaluation of the course.

The first section is intended to be completed the first day of the course. The second section will be explained between the first and last days of the course, while students will be able to practice the concepts learned. The third section will be completed by the students during the last day of the course.

## How to follow the course?
